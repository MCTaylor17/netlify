    <h1>Who is Mike Taylor?</h1>
    <p>Mike's interest in the web started in the early 2000's at the beginning of the "Web 2.0" era.  At that time, he was primarily interested in the "what" rather than the "how".  Much of this time was spent doodling on the back of napkins and philosophizing without much action.</p>
  
    <p>In 2009, Mike entered a career exploration program that identified a strong aptitude for both technical and creative careers.  This led him to take a 2 year diploma in <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/business/marketing/">Marketing Management at BCIT</a>.  After graduating with honours, Mike found himself volunteering at HiVE Vancouver, a based co-working organization focused on social responsibility.  In addition to helping with some marketing activities, he also spent many nights monitoring Meetups.  Still enthusiastic about technology, he eagerly signed up for anything related to the web.  It was here, watching over gatherings related to coding and web development that Mike became inspired to go back to school once more.</p>
  
    <p>At the start of 2014, Mike enrolled in the <a href="https://bcitwebdeveloper.ca/">Technical Web Design Program (TWD)</a> offered through the High Tech Professional (HTP) school at BCIT.  This was a 6 month intensive program covering a wide range of skills, including graphic design, user experience design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Wordpress.  Mike did well in this environment and finished out the program with a small contract working for the school.</p>

    <p>In mid-2014, Mike joined the <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/ltc/">Learning and Teaching Center (LTC)</a> at BCIT.  What started as a 2 month contract position turned into a journey to reinvent their online course production process. 4 years later, Mike had created multiple frontend frameworks and a suite of tools for easily converting simple MS Word documents into feature rich HTML pages, ready for upload into the Learning Management System.</p>
